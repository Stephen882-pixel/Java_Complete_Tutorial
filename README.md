About the Project

This repository is designed to help beginners and intermediate Java developers learn the basics and advanced concepts of Java programming. It covers fundamental concepts such as control flows, variables, data types, and arrays, as well as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and interfaces.

Additionally, this project includes a simple ATM system built using OOP principles to provide a practical example of how these concepts can be applied.
Features

    Covers Java fundamentals in a clear and concise way.
    Explains key OOP concepts with practical examples.
    Includes a simple ATM project to demonstrate real-world application of OOP principles.
    User-friendly code with ample comments and explanations.
    Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (JDK 8 or higher).
    Any Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
    Git for cloning the repository.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/java_complete_tutorial.git

    Open the project in your preferred IDE.

    Compile and run the Java files for the tutorials or navigate to the atmProject for the OOP project.



Tutorial Topics
Fundamental Concepts

    Control Flows: if, else, switch, for, while, and do-while loops.
    Variables and Data Types: Primitive types, reference types, and variable scope.
    Operators: Arithmetic, logical, relational, and assignment operators.
    Arrays: One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.
    Input/Output: Taking input from the user and displaying output using Scanner and System.out.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

    Inheritance: Reusing code through class hierarchy and super keyword.
    Encapsulation: Keeping fields private and exposing them through public methods.
    Abstraction: Using abstract classes and interfaces to hide implementation details.
    Interfaces: Defining contracts for classes to implement.

ATM Project

The ATM project is a simple simulation of an automated teller machine that showcases Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java.
Project Functionality:

    Customer Authentication: The user enters a customer number and PIN to authenticate.
    Account Selection: Once authenticated, the user selects either the Savings Account or Checking Account.
    Deposit/Withdraw Funds: The user can deposit or withdraw money from the selected account. The system ensures that the user cannot withdraw more money than what is available.
    Balance Calculation: The system automatically updates and displays the balance after each transaction.

Files:

    ATM.java: Handles user interactions and manages accounts.
    Customer.java: Represents customer details, including customer number and PIN.
    Account.java: A superclass representing general account behavior.
    CheckingAccount.java and SavingsAccount.java: Subclasses inheriting from Account and implementing specific account functionality.
